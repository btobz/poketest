# Pokétest

The pokétest project is one devoted to providing an easy way for pokéfans to research all 802 pokémon. The information presented in this web app is received from the PokéAPI database (an API devoted to collecting all information about Pokéon and storing it in one place. This web app allows users to search for any pokémon either by name or number. The app will then return basic information about the pokémon in an aesthetically pleasing format, in addition to that pokémon's sprite. The user then has the option to view the "shiny" version of the sprite (a much rarer version of that same pokémon that can possibly be encountered in the game.

This project was developed in order to show progress of my growing understanding of the React framework. In this project I have presented an understanding of how to fetch information from an api, how to code css in order to format the page more effectively, as well as how to search through the fetched information from that api. As this project continues to develop, new skills will be demonstrated.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## *Getting Started:*

### Prerequisites:

#### Installing Nodejs, npm, Ubuntu, & Yarn:

Before beginning to view/contribute to this project, please download the following:

On Windows, make sure to install [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Ubuntu for Windows](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0). If you are interested, you may also consider installing [Yarn for Windows](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable). Yarn is similar to npm, however `yarn start` is able to start the local client more quickly than `npm start` will be able to. These will all be used to run our web apps in a localhost.

### Running the App:

Once you have the folder saved onto your computer, access the working directory of the folder then run

`yarn start` or `npm start`.

##### Example:

```bash
bradytobin@Brady:~$ cd /mnt/c/repos/poketest
bradytobin@Brady:/mnt/c/repos/poketest$ yarn start
```

## *Built With:*

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript library for building user interfaces that was used.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Editing and debugging software used.

## *Contributing:*

### GitHub:

After you edit some portion of this web app, you may request to have your contribution added to the master branch by creating a new branch:

`git checkout -b feature_branch_name`

After editing, adding, and committing your files, you can push your branch to the remote repository:

`git push -u origin feature_branch_name`
