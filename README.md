# Pokétest

The pokétest project is one devoted to providing an easy way for pokéfans to research all 802 pokémon. The information presented in this web app is received from the PokéAPI database (an API devoted to collecting all information about Pokéon and storing it in one place. This web app allows users to search for any pokémon either by name or number. The app will then return basic information about the pokémon in an aesthetically pleasing format, in addition to that pokémon's sprite. The user then has the option to view the "shiny" version of the sprite (a much rarer version of that same pokémon that can possibly be encountered in the game.

This project was developed in order to show progress of my growing understanding of the React framework. In this project I have presented an understanding of how to fetch information from an api, how to code css in order to format the page more effectively, as well as how to search through the fetched information from that api. As this project continues to develop, new skills will be demonstrated.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
